            Our life is the time we spend and/or invest. Jobs take up a disproportional amount of that time. If we want to live in a world with equality and happiness, we need to have fulfilling jobs that pay us a living wage.

          So let's get some data :)
          </p>
          <div class='text'>
            <p>
              In 2010 a guy named Daniel Kahneman did some research [3]. He thought that in 2010, on average, living on less than $75k per year in the United States would lead to increased stress and unhappiness. But don't take my word for it; here's what he said:
              <ul>
                <li>"We conclude that lack of money brings both emotional misery and low life evaluation; similar results were found for anger."
                </li>
                <li>
                  "More money (> $75k in 2010) does not necessarily buy more happiness, but less money is associated with emotional pain."
                </li>
                <li>
                  "We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being."
                </li>
              </ul>
              So, while money doesn't buy happiness, it does cap your downside risk by minimizing pain and suffering. Capping downside risk isn't just a nice to have: it means being able to eat healthy food, spend time with loved ones, and focusing productively without added stressors. It also means that if the average American was making 75k a year they would actually be able to do things like make thier rent payments, exercise, have decent healthcare, pursue extracurricular activities, and maybe even put asside some money in savings to pay down debt or buy a house. All in all these things lead to happiness and productivity, and money gives you the opportunity to pursue them. [4].

              This is all well and good, but as we've all seen the United States is not a homogenous entity[87]. Some cities or areas are more expensive than others, and so the benchmark at which one can live comfortably and productively needs to be adjusted accordingly. With this in mind, let's look at NYC.

              NYC is a thriving metropolis of culture and diversity. It's also ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in[45]. If we were to adjust the "happiness benchmark" for NYC rather than an average of the United States we would see a very different picture[5][6]. If we were to then fast forward from 2010 (when the survey was done) to today (2019), we might even be shocked! Let's see what happened :)

          Life is hard.

          <div class='text'>
            <p>
              Ok, so all of that happiness stuff is well and good, but let's be real: life isn't all sunshine and roses. Hard things are hard, and that's ok, but let's look at the facts. What were the increases in the cost of living: things like the rate of inflation, the increases in rent, and increases in other things like healthcare, transportation, and food? The City of New York was curious too so they looked into it [7].
            </p>
              <ul class='text'>
                <li>Rent takes up the majority of income[92], with 1/3 being the average[7].
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rents have increased 5%/yr[7], but in the last few years they've increased between 20-45% in many Manhatten neighborhoods[8], with 31% being the average increase since 2010 [9] (the "happiness index" was modeled on the costs of living at that time).
                </li>
                <li>
                  but... The income requirements are anywhere from 40 to 50 times the rent of the NYC rental apartment[73]. Using that formula, someone renting an apartment for $3,000 a month must earn at least $120,000 a year [69][88].

              Hold your horses... so you're telling me that every month:
              <ul>
                <li>the minimum you have to pay in infrastructure costs for things like rent, water, electric, heating, garbage, internet, phone, and transportation is 3k
                </li>
                <li>
                  basics things like food, clothes, furniture, computers, etc... are on average 2k (or more if you ever have to pay $30 for a sandwich, a drink, and some chips)
                </li>
                <li>
                  and then on top of that you need another 2k for taxes and health insurance...
                </li>
                <li>
                  and after that whatever you're left with afterwards can be put towards paying off your loans, saving up to buy a house, or... maybe... just maybe... entertainment and/or a vacation???
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              So... the "happiness benchmark" is really just the "I can eat and pay my bills without working 3 jobs benchmark"?
              <br>
              <br>
              And you need at minimum 100k a year even to be elligible to pay 1/3 of your salary towards rent and then "survive" (pay bills) on your own?
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              I don't believe it... let's check the data.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The cost of living in NYC is X% more than the national average.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 2010 as a national average the minimum one needed to make to cap downside risk associated with stress, financial ruin, and deliquincy was 75k.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adjusting that for NYC thats actually more like 90k, in 2010.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adjusting that for NYC in 2019 that's actually more like 120k.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If we then look at the budget we laid out for a single human to live in NYC, it's roughly between 100k and 120k.
                </li>
              </ul>
              As we saw from the original paper, money caps downside risk that comes with financial burdens and loss of health and opportunities, but it does not buy happiness. Considering that in NYC you need the amount of money equivalent to the "happiness benchmark" just to survive and not go into debt, that makes sense.

            Well this is sad. In one of the most developed nations on earth, most people, on average, are below the "happiness benchmark": aka unable to take care of basic neccesities and more likely to incur "emotional pain", "misry", and "anger" [3]. Most people in the world are not in developed nations, so it goes without saying that they're probably not super stoked about things either.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile... the finance and sofware industries enjoy the highest margins of any industry to date [90]. So... who is Web3 really going to empower with cryptoeconomic mechanisms like blockchains: everyday folk who can't make rent, or people who understand the intersection of finance and software? As naive as it sounds, hopefully both :)
